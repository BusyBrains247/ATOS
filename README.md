# A.T.O.S.

### Meaning
It stands for *Automated Tournament Organizer for Smash*, or more precisely *Automation Tools for Organizing Smash*, whatever you like. It's designed to run on a Discord server and it can "take it from here", i.e. managing a Smash tournament with Challonge for the bracket stuff.

**While the code should be working (and I try to keep it as clean as possible), keep in mind I'm not a dev, just a smasher with some CS skills doing that as a hobby!**

### Tech
`discord.py` and `pychal`, and a bunch of other Python packages.

### What does it do?
- Registration
- Check-in
- Match queue
- Unique channel for each set
- Stream queue
- Score detection
- Reminders
- Auto-DQ
- Announcements (including results)
- Welcoming new members
- Some commands
- Roles gestion
- Multi-game supports (Smash-focused)

>The idea : you create the tournament on Challonge, you pass the URL to the bot with a Discord command, and it takes it from here (from handling the registration to posting the final results, at the exception of determining which sets should be on stream). Cool, right?

### Use
Its primary use is, as you can see, for a french server which is organizing online weeklies for Smash Bros. Ultimate. You can use it for your own, you can enhance it, that's your call.

### How to install
I'll provide some documentation as soon as I can. Take care!
