# A.T.O.S.

## What?
It stands for *Automated Tournament Organizer for Smash*, or more precisely *Automation Tools for Organizing Smash*, whatever you like. It's designed to run on a Discord server and it can "take it from here", i.e. managing a Smash tournament with Challonge for the bracket stuff.

While the code should be somewhat working, **keep in mind I'm not a dev** (at least I don't consider myself to be one), just a smasher with some CS skills doing that as a hobby! You're free to fork, to contribute, and to use my work in whatever way you want.

## Main requirements
`discord.py` (rewrite) : [powerful API wrapper for Discord](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), credits to Danny.
`apychal` : [asynchronous fork](https://github.com/Wonderfall/apychal) of `pychal` made by myself, credits to ZEDGR.

## What does it do?
- Registration
- Check-in
- Waiting list
- Match queue
- Unique channel for each set
- Stream queue
- Score detection
- Reminders
- Auto-DQ
- Announcements (including results)
- Greeting new members (optional)
- Roles managing (optional)
- Multi-game supports (Smash-focused)
- Seeding (based on a braacket ranking)
- Automatic tournament creation
- Bunch of useful commands

Did I forget something?

## Can I use it?
Its primary use is, as you can see, for a french server which is organizing online weeklies for Smash Bros. Ultimate. You can use it for your own, you can enhance it, that's your call. I'm not responsible for a thermonuclear warfare in your Discord server because you installed it!

## How to install?
I'll provide some documentation as soon as I can. Take care!

## Thanks
