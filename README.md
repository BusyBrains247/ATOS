# A.T.O.S.

### Meaning
It stands for *Automated Tournament Organizer for Smash*, or more precisely *Automation Tools for Organizing Smash*, whatever you like. It's designed to run on a Discord server and it can "take it from here", i.e. managing a Smash tournament with Challonge for the bracket stuff.

### Tech
`discord.py` and `pychal`, and a bunch of other Python packages. That's all.

### Use
Its primary use is, as you can see, for a french server which is organizing online weeklies for Smash Bros. Ultimate. You can use it for your own, you can enhance it, that's your call.

### How to install
I'll provide some documentation as soon as I can. Take care!

### Thanks
*Smash Strasbourg community (especially), Smash Void, kheyFC.*
